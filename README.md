# HTML5Slate
HTML5Slate is a simple, open source, html5 clapperboard application. It's been written in plain simple html5, css3, and javascript. The audio file was generated using Bxfr audio generator and edited using Audacity.

It is particularly useful for screencasting when the audio is recorded in an asynchronous manner.

I developed this tool for my own use, so I didn't care much for writing the cleanest possible code. Feel free to send me any comments or suggestions

## Download and Installation
Simply clone the repository, or download and extract the downloadable archive.

## Usage
Open `slate.html` in an html5 capable browser. When you're ready, click **Clap** button. That's it :-)

Optionally, you may fill the slate board as desired.

## Known issues:
Sometimes the first clap is out of sync due to a delay in loading audio object. Simply click the Clap button a couple of times to sync.

I have tested it on Chrome (v. 25.0.1364.172), Firefox (v. 12.0), and Safari (V. 6.0.2 (8536.26.17)), all on Mac OS X. If you find any issues on a specific HTML5 capable browser, please let me know.
